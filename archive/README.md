This folder is a record for inactive pages of my website, categorized by the date of (unofficial) retirement. I opted to decommission these for a variety of reasons, most of which are outlined below:

### 2016-01-06
- **Object of retirement**: The CS 61A page
- **Rationale**: The template used by the 61A page was originally meant as a photo viewer. To make a long story short, I repurposed said design and it gave me hell. There was _always_ something wrong with the 61A subpage... whether it was the iOS deep freeze or the Firefox scrollbar that wouldn't go away. In the end, I guess I decided that it was more trouble than it was worth and just got rid of it.

### 2015-12-03
- **Object of retirement**: The landing page [ _index.html_, _style.css_, _script.min.js_ ]
- **Rationale**: Who quotes the Lego Movie on their landing page? It was just a little too cheesy and always kind of meant as an interim display. I mean, I think I can do a bit better (...but hey, don't hold me to that!).
