## Attendance (5 minutes)
On the board:
```
CS 61A
Section 125 (Th 5-6:30pm)
Owen Jow (owenjow@berkeley.edu)
```

Take attendance (name, email, SID). You – the student – can either do this via Google Form (link: [tiny.cc/disc0](http://tiny.cc/disc0)) or on paper, which you can pass in anytime during class.

## Introduction (25 minutes)
Welcome to CS 61A discussion! My name's Owen and I'll be the TA for Discussion 125 this year. I'm a 2nd year CS student from the Bay Area (Los Altos). I took CS 61A during my first semester at Berkeley and enjoyed it immensely, which I tell you now is one of the secrets to success. You should generally try to do stuff you enjoy! Luckily, CS 61A is a pretty well-designed course and I'm sure everybody can find SOMETHING to have fun with.

#### Icebreaker
Name, year, and a fact about yourself. For example, any good food you've had in Berkeley, what you did over break, where you're from, your major, a book/movie you've haven't read/watched that's embarrassing, etc. BUT there's a catch: you're going to break up into pairs (preferably someone sitting next to you) and then introduce EACH OTHER to the class.

## Lost on the Moon (30 minutes)
1. Get into groups of 1 and do the worksheet.
2. Get into groups of 3-4 and do the worksheet.
3. Go over solutions and talk about the scores.

The point: to demonstrate that the collective almost always works better than the individual. (Similar to wisdom of the crowd.)

## How to Succeed in CS 61A (20 minutes)
Questions on the board (discuss these in groups):

#### Discussion #1: What is a computer scientist? What is a programmer? What skills do they need?
(Draw slope vs. y-intercept on the board.)

A computer scientist is someone who studies what computers [can] do. A programmer is someone who actually makes computers do things. The difference between the two is similar to the difference between architecture and construction. Broadly speaking, I would argue that computer science combines theory and practice. To really understand what you CAN do, you also have to be able to do stuff.

Some of the most important skills required: Tenacity, grit, and resistance to failure. Everyone fails. The important thing is that you GET YOURSELF UP. Everyone is expected to struggle at some points in 61A. You **shouldn't feel bad about this**; even the best computer scientists get stuck all the time. The difference: they know how to get unstuck more quickly (hint: Google searches + STACK OVERFLOW + talking to others). This is something that _can be learned_.

#### Discussion #2: How do you learn in this class? What is _necessary_ for success?
You learn by reading/hearing, and then **doing**. You'll probably never understand something 100% before starting a project or a problem set.

#### Discussion #3: What are some of the advantages and disadvantages to working with others?
Advantages: access to more skills/ideas/perspectives, more fun, more support, more liability, ...

Disadvantages: resistance to change, less motivating jobs, difficulty in agreeing on things, excess or lack of participation (division of labor), ...

Key takeaway: Teamwork is good. Break the mentality that helping others or asking for help will make you weaker. You don’t have to do everything yourself in order to understand everything. So get to know each other! You should start trying to make partners if you haven't already.

## Questions / Closing Remarks
1. If anyone still needs help with setup, feel free to stay after class and I'll try to assist you.
2. Always feel free to shoot me an email. These can be about anything! I can't guarantee that I'll tell you what you want to hear, but I _can_ guarantee that I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
3. Thanks for coming!
