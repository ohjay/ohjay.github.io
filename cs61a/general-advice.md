    Sit down, friend, and let me give you some advice.
</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify">
    <li>In terms of studying, twenty solid minutes every day is better than 50 hours in the three days before the exam. It's also a lot more comfortable.</li><br>
    <li>Look for opportunities to teach things to your peers. They say you haven't truly mastered the material until you can explain it for somebody else to understand â€“ and we're aiming for mastery here!</li><br>
    <li>Convince yourself that you enjoy this material and that you <i>want</i> to learn it. Once you have that, everything else will come a lot easier.</li><br>
    <li>For best results, keep up with the lecture topics. It's not easy to be the hero and make up tons of lost ground. Plus, John DeNero's voice is music to the ears of any sane human being.</li><br>
    <li>In order to become better at something, what do you do? You practice it until you improve (and then you practice some more). The same idea applies to 61A. If you want to get better at coding problems, do a ton of coding problems. If you want to get better at recursion, take in and write a lot of recursive programs. <i>That's how you learn.</i></li>
</ul>
