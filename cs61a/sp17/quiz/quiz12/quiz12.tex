\textbf{Self-Referential Aptitude Test, by James Propp \textit{\href{http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/srat-Q.txt}{(source)}}}
\end{center}

The solution to the following puzzle is unique; in some cases the
knowledge that the solution is unique may actually give you a shortcut 
to finding the answer to a particular question.

I (James Propp) should mention that if you don't agree with me about the answer to \#20, 
you will get a different solution to the puzzle than the one I had in mind.  
But I should also mention that if you don't agree with me about the answer 
to \#20, you are just plain wrong.  :-)

\textbf{Note from Owen:} This is just for fun. Fun is important. That is all...
