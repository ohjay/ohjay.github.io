This quiz will not affect your grade. It is meant to be an evaluation of your own understanding. It is also your attendance, so make sure to hand it in. Have fun!\newline

I will also (mock) grade and return them to you next week as feedback. Or the next time you show up. If ever. Whatever floats your boat.
