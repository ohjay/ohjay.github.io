## Sequences and Data Abstraction
**Sequences** have length and allow for element selection.

**Data abstraction** means creating a representation of some real-life object in Python. Usually, the object consists of multiple pieces of data. **Do not violate abstraction barriers**. Only the constructors and selectors should know how the ADT is actually implemented.

I can break a function that doesn't respect the abstraction barrier without changing anything in its body. (In class: modify constructors and selectors. "_What did I just do?_")

Vocabulary: ADT, constructor, selector, underlying representation, abstraction barrier, abstraction violation
