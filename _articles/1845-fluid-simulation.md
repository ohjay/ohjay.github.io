# Fluid Simulation

<br />

> [Read the full writeup.](/graphics/1845)

<br />

As a basic OpenGL simulation, we represent fluids as particles and model their interactions. To do so, we store these particles in a uniform grid while imposing incompressibility, adding artificial pressure, and forcing particles apart when they collide. With the intention of getting things moving, we initialize the particles at a certain height and allow gravity to act upon them.

This project was completed in a lamentably brief amount of time with [Arissa Wongpanich](http://arissaw.weebly.com/).
