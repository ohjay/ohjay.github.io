There's not much to say here. Since a website is worth a thousand words, you can probably learn more simply by visiting [the page itself](http://owenjow.xyz).

This is the personal website of Owen Michael Jow, in which Owen Michael Jow will engage in a lot of shameless self-promotion and overall focus on nothing but himself. If that interests you at all, you should ~~get your head examined~~ check it out! Just be sure to grab some popcorn before you do. :)

### Acknowledgments
Of course, this undertaking would not have been possible without the indefatigable efforts of the countless others who have gone before. Owen would therefore like to publicize his appreciation for the following libraries, frameworks, and plugins (and credit them for their part in his website!):

- [Zoomooz.js](http://jaukia.github.io/zoomooz/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
