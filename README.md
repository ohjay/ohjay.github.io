There's not much to say here. Since a website is worth a thousand words, you can probably learn more by skipping the small talk and simply [visiting the page yourself](http://owenjow.xyz).

This is the personal website of Owen Michael Jow, in which Owen Michael Jow will engage in a lot of shameless self-promotion and overall focus on nothing but himself. If that interests you at all, you should ~~get your head examined~~ check it out! Just be sure to grab some popcorn before you do. :)

### Acknowledgments
Of course, this undertaking would not have been possible without the efforts of countless others who've gone before. Owen would therefore like to publicize his appreciation for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Justin Aguilar](http://www.justinaguilar.com/animations/index.html), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (alongside [Poole](http://getpoole.com/)/[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/)).
