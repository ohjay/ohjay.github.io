<h1>Fiat lux.</h1>

<br />

<blockquote>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
    
    <br /><br />
    
    And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
    
    <br /><br />
    
    And God saw the light, and it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
</blockquote>

For the record, you will never find me quoting scripture in real life. But there is cause today – cause enough for me to look up this passage (the origin of "fiat lux"), enjoy it, and circulate it like a lemming on social media. Light is the foundation for our visual systems; without light, graphics would not exist. And it is because of graphics, I hope, that you are reading these words in the first place.

You're on my site, so it's likely you already know who I am. I won't bore you on that front. Instead, I'll invite <em>you</em> to bore yourself by browsing the CG articles I've posted (and will post) on this self-indulgent showcase of mine. On the plus side, it's possible you can learn something more about the visual realm of computer science, or in another reality be bedazzled by the awesome imagery of some of my projects. My goal in life is to be able to show people things that no one has seen before (really, from a literal standpoint – this is <em>graphics</em>!); things that are new. In time, perhaps.

<br /><br />

I return now to my original point. While it's true that almost everything we do requires light in some form, it is an absolute dependency for visual computing. Until we've invented Braille imagery, we have to have our eyes to appreciate this stuff... and our eyes have to have light! So unlike a functional record I'd like to say – one last time – let there be light, indeed.

Anyway, if you feel like telling me how brilliant I am, you can email me at <span class="rev-denero">ude.yelekreb.wojnewo</span>. (If need be, you can also send me – you know – questions and stuff. :)
