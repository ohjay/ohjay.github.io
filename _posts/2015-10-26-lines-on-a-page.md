title: Lines on a Page
---

Do you ever think about how words are just lines on a page? Or sounds in the air? Or electrical signals in someone's brain? It's <sup><sub>きょうみぶかい</sub></sup> (that's 'very interesting,' for those of you who don't speak sushi). We decided to give meaning to <em>these</em> specific lines; <em>these</em> specific sounds. Many times over, in many different languages. And you know what? I think that from a certain point of view<sup><sub><sup><sub> </sub></sup></sub>1</sup> everyone is at least bilingual. Because in addition to the language(s) they use to communicate with other people, everyone has their own language. Their own meanings.

That's the one they use to communicate with themselves.

Maybe you've never thought about it before, but that doesn't mean you can't think about it now. How are you doing? How do you <em>know</em><sup><sub> </sub></sup>? I know how <em>I</em> like to figure it out: I write about it (to myself. Yeah, I'm cool). That's my medium; my form of self-communication. Writing. And yes, I know I'm technically writing in English. Look, didn't you hear my bit about 'a certain point of view?'

Okay, in all honesty that was just me trying to start off my [public] blog with something thought-provoking. At first, I was going to write about how I spent ten minutes staring at the back of a pizza box, but then I realized that such a topic, while admittedly being very stimulating, <em>might</em> not portray me in the best possible light. First impressions are important, right?

Speaking of first impressions <sup><sub>&ndash;</sub></sup> hey there! My name is Owen. I'm very tired right now and soon I shall go to bed. But first I wanted to kick this blog off. My website's coming together reasonably nicely, I think, and with luck I'll have some more content on this thing before long. 

By the way: don't expect all my posts to be 'techy' or even at all intellectual. I don't do intellectual. All I can guarantee are lines on a page. Hopefully they'll have some meaning to you, but even if they don't, well, that's fine. Because they certainly do for me.

[Author's note #1] I want to have a signature here.<br>
[Author's note #2] Thus, I will almost certainly edit this.<br>
[Author's note #3] I cannot remember the last time I was this tired.
