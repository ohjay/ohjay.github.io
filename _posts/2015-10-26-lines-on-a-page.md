title: Lines on a Page
---

Do you ever think about how words are just lines on a page? Or sounds in the air? Or electrical signals in someone's brain? It's <sup><sub>きょうみぶかい</sub></sup> (that's 'very interesting,' for those of you who don't speak <sup><sub>日本語</sub></sup>). Of all the possibilities, we decided to give meaning to <em>these</em> specific lines and <em>these</em> specific sounds. Many times over, in fact, in many different languages. And you know what? I think that from a certain point of view<sup><sub><sup><sub> </sub></sup></sub>1</sup> everyone is at least bilingual. Because in addition to the language(s) they use to communicate with other people, everyone has their own language. Their own set of triggers and meanings.

That's the one they use to communicate with themselves.

Maybe you've never thought about it before, but that doesn't mean you can't think about it now. How are you doing? How do you <em>know</em><sup><sub> </sub></sup>? I know how <em>I</em> like to figure it out: I write about it (to myself. Yeah, I'm cool). That's my medium; my form of self-communication. Writing. And yes, I know I'm technically writing in the language that is English. Look, didn't you hear my bit about 'a certain point of view?'

It varies among different people. I mean, the foundation will usually involve the five physical senses plus, arguably, thought. But from there the tree diverges: it's what we choose to do and how we choose to think that really shape our own personal language. Consider this: a certain song or pastime will often have a meaning for me that is nothing like its meaning for you. As I involve myself in that endeavor, I end up imposing some interpretation on the experience&#46;&#46;&#46; and creating a linguistic feedback loop that speaks both to myself and to anyone I decide to include.

That, then, is what you're seeing right now. Theoretically, at least. (In truth, this was mostly just an attempt to kick off my [public] blog with something thought-provoking. At first I was going to write about how I spent ten minutes staring at the back of a pizza box. Soon, however, I realized that such a topic <sup><sub>&ndash;</sub></sup> while admittedly being very stimulating <sup><sub>&ndash;</sub></sup> might not portray me in the best possible light.)

But I digress. Here we have a post's worth of this 'language' of mine. And since this is my <em>first</em> post, I just wanted to let you know who I am and what's in store for this grand old webpage. In response to the first point, my name is Owen and I'm a very tired college student with no better way to pass the time while I wait for my potatoes to brown.

Meanwhile, I'd say that this blog has quite a busy-looking future. I'm planning all kinds of content (for example, a web development guide for people with low attention spans, people with no experience, and people who have no idea what they're doing). Ultimately, though, don't expect my posts to be 'techy' or even remotely intellectual. I don't do 'intellectual.' All I can guarantee are lines on a page. And hopefully they'll have some meaning for you, but even if they don't, well, that's fine. Because they certainly do for me.
