title: Some Environment Diagram Stuff
---

Hey everyone, just posting a document covering some of the different code cases that you'll see for environment diagrams. (These were originally the windmill slides I passed over in discussion.) Unfortunately I didn't get around to writing the solutions, but you can always check them for yourself in [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/composingprograms.html#mode=edit)!

Said document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MAUC6UrYoSkaAI8S6YLXCNnsWJYAsjQvBLG_yQbhqVM/edit?usp=sharing).
