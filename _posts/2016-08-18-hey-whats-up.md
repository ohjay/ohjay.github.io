Enrollment numbers, for one. :)

Hello students â€“ all 1700+ of you! A few more people and we'll be ready to declare independence and form our own nation-state. Anyway, I can't wait to rush from Li Ka Shing to section every Tuesday/Thursday and spend the semester with some new faces. Hopefully you're feeling pretty thrilled yourself (perhaps about the all-encompassing world of computer science). If you're looking for something specific to get excited about, know that midterm #1 is only 22 days after the first lecture...
