Enrollment numbers, for one. :)

Hello students â€“ all 1700+ of you! A few more people and we'll be ready to form our own nation-state. Or 130 underwater football teams; I could definitely go for either. Anyway, I can't wait to rush from LKS to section every Tuesday/Thursday and spend the semester with some brilliant new bears. Hopefully you're feeling pretty thrilled yourself, perhaps about the all-encompassing world of computer science. If anyone is looking for a specific reason to get hyped, know that midterm #1 is only 22 days after the first lecture... :!
