title: Brief Overview of MT1 Topics
---

Hello students! I know you've been looking forward to today's midterm and that you're probably swamped in all the review material our course has accumulated over the years. In light of this, I've thrown together my own "last-minute" topical overview. Naturally, it is in no way superior to [really any] other resources you would have come across... and is indeed less useful in a good number of ways. In fact, given a choice between it and any other exam prep, I would choose the other exam prep 9 out of 9 times.

So why am I wasting your time with this? Well, perhaps you have already exhausted every alternative form of study material. Maybe you are simply bored of them. Conceivably you are insane. If any of these cases describe you, it won't hurt to skim my words.

Oh yeah. As a disclaimer, I wrote a vast majority of it before looking at the midterm â€“ so there's really no telling if it will be primed in that regard.

Anyway, I suppose you can check it out for yourself. (At worst, it'll just be a pretty quick read.) Without further ado I present to you a PDF.

Seriously though, best of luck! I'm rooting for you.
