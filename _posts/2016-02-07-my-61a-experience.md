title: My 61A Experience
---

For some reason, everyone wants to know what _I_ did when I was in CS 61A. I'm not going to lie: I was actually a pretty good student. Who would have thought?

To be honest, I came in expecting the worst. I'd heard horror stories about the Cal standard: students going multiple days without sleep; projects that only the professor could debug; exams with class averages in the 40s. My dad, an orthodontist who didn't go to Berkeley, kept telling me that all of my peers would have been programming since they were 8 years old.

Because of this, I made sure I studied hard. I did most of the readings, watched all of the lectures, and started homeworks and projects pretty damn early. It was a big change from high school. 

And it paid off! My experience was nothing like the stories I'd heard. I always got a lot of sleep and the projects honestly felt pretty straightforward (mainly because I kept up with the material). Meanwhile, a majority of the people I talked to had no prior knowledge whatsoever.

So to keep a short story short, 61A went pretty smoothly for me. Not because I'm some kind of savant, but because I _put in the work_. And I enjoyed it. It was fun and I was always excited to find a new challenge.

If there was somehow a moral to this story, it'd be this: as long as you study a lot and enjoy the material, you'll do fine in 61A. I guarantee it.
