Due to the midterm, section this week is optional. However, I'll be in 254 Dwinelle from 5:05 to 5:40 for any last minute Q&A, so feel free to drop in for that.

To clarify, we will not be going through a worksheet and I will only cover material as you request beforehand (or ask about between 5:05 and 5:40). If you think this may be useful, I recommend you show up. If you don't, I recommend you spend your time doing something that _is_ useful... like eating dinner :)

As a final announcement, I threw together a [MT1 tip sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vGO6_7i-T2cZL8gyl3FUcrQSv1kKZshdgUbnlcXMUkg/edit?usp=sharing). Try giving it a skim sometime before the midterm!
