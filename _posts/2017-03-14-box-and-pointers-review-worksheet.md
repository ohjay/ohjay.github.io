title: Box and Pointers Review Worksheet
---

Hey guys, back with a bit of review material for your second midterm. More specifically I've got a worksheet on box-and-pointer diagrams; apart from Spring 2016 MT2 there hasn't been a lot of chance for such practice. Incidentally, it was suggested in our staff meeting that we go over box-and-pointer diagrams in lab... which, you know, may or may not imply something about their relevance to the exam. (Read: _I do suggest you do these._)

[Here's](/cs61a/sp17/box_and_pointers/worksheet.pdf) the worksheet. [Here](/cs61a/sp17/box_and_pointers/worksheet_sol.pdf) are the solutions.

I'll also walk through the first question in lab tomorrow, for those of you who might not understand boxes and/or pointers. And/or diagrams.

Godspeed, all â€“ <br>
