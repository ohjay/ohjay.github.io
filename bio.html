  <h1>Biographical Sketch</h1>
  <h2>OWEN JOW</h2>
  <p><b>
    Owen Jow is a master's CS student at UC San Diego with a concentration in computer graphics and vision. Previously, he received a bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley. For the most part, his life has followed a research trajectory. While at Berkeley, he did research in Pieter Abbeel's Robot Learning Lab on VR-based deep (R)L for robot control. He has also been an intern at Adobe Research, working under Duygu Ceylan on 3D human pose estimation from monocular video. Over the course of his journey, Owen has had the great fortune to work with (among others) Pieter Abbeel, Zoe McCarthy, Tianhao Zhang, Dennis Lee, Duygu Ceylan, Jimei Yang, and Jianming Zhang.

    The other focus of Owen's professional career has been teaching. At Berkeley, he was involved in some teaching capacity, mostly as a TA, for seven semesters across three classes: CS 61A (introductory), CS 194-26 (computational photography), and CS 170 (algorithms). At UCSD, he will be a TA for CSE 152 (computer vision).
